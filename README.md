# Text-Image-Extraction-from-PDF
Develop a program that extracts highlighted text from a PDF document and compares it with text from a `notes.txt` file for each color of highlighting. The program should utilize an open-source Large Language Model (LLM) for text comparison and return the similarity percentage (ranging from 0 to 100%) for the text corresponding to each color.
